Players are asked to connect to a remote server via netcat and go through a series of text-based prompts. The game presents multiple-choice questions (such as A, B, or C), and users are expected to select the correct options based on context — for example, choosing \"C\" to register a private account. Once the flow is completed correctly, the server will reveal the flag as a reward.\n\n### Solution:\n1. **Connect to the server:**\n\t\n\t![f](./)\n\t\n3. **Interact with the simulation:**\n\tOnce connected, you will be prompted with a series of choices like:\n\t\n\t![f]()\n\n\t![f]()\n\t\n4. **Retrieve the flag:**\n\tAt the end of the interaction, the terminal will display the flag. Copy and save it.\n\t\n\t![f]()\n\n### Flag:\n**picoCTF{m1113n1um_3d1710n_da2cd4b9}**\n"
