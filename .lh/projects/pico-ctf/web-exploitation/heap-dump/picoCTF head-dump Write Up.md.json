The head was dumped.\n\n### Analysis:\nFirst, access the blog to locate a link to `/api-docs/`, confirming a Swagger UI is enabled. Through Swagger, we find a `GET /heapdump` endpoint—unusual for production—which likely exposes a memory dump. The heap dump is typically a large JSON/text file (e.g., Node.js). Because flags are often included in memory as strings, a quick search using `strings` and `grep` should reveal it\n\n### Solution:\n1. **Access Swagger UI:**\n\n\tNavigating to:\n\n\t![f](./documentation/Screenshot%20(725).png)\n\n2.  **Download the Heap Snapshot:**\n\n\t![f]()\n\n\t\n3. **Determine file type & search the flag:**\n\n\t![f]()\n\n### Flag:\n\n"
