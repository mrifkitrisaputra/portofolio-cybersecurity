Dive into the network traffic, apply the right filters and show off your forensic prowess and unmask the digital intruder!\n\n### Hint:\n1. Filter your packets to narrow down your search.\n2. Attacks were done in timely manner.\n3. Time is essential\n\n### Analysis:\nInside the PCAP, several TCP packets carry Base64-encoded data, but they are out of order time-wise. By filtering packets of specific lengths, extracting TCP payloads, sorting by timestamp, decoding Base64, and concatenating the output in correct order, we can reconstruct the full flag.\n\n### Solution:\n1. **Download file PCAP:**\n\t\n\t![f](./documentation/Screenshot%202025-06-23%20131230.png)\n\n2. **Filter & extract payloads:**\n\n\tUse tshark to extract TCP payloads from TPC packets of desired lengths:\n\n\t![f]()\n\t\n3.  **Sort & decode:**\n\n\t![f]()\n\n### Flag:\n**picoCTF{1t_w4snt_th4t_34sy_tbh_4r_959f50d3}**\n"
