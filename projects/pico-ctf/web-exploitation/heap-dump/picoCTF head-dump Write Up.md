##  CTF Name: head-dump (Easy)

### Description:
Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the server’s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.

### Hint:
1. Explore backend development with us
2. The head was dumped.

### Analysis:
First, access the blog to locate a link to `/api-docs/`, confirming a Swagger UI is enabled. Through Swagger, we find a `GET /heapdump` endpoint—unusual for production—which likely exposes a memory dump. The heap dump is typically a large JSON/text file (e.g., Node.js). Because flags are often included in memory as strings, a quick search using `strings` and `grep` should reveal it

### Solution:
1. **Access Swagger UI:**

	Navigating to:

2.  **Download the Heap Snapshot:**

3. **Determine file type & search the flag:**
